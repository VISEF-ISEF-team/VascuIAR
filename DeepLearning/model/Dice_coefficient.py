def dice_coefficient(y_true, y_pred, smooth=1):
    """
    Computes the Dice coefficient, a statistical metric used for comparing the similarity 
    of two samples. It is especially used for comparing the pixel-wise agreement between a 
    predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth.

    The Dice coefficient is defined as 2 * |X âˆ© Y| / (|X|+|Y|), where X is the true mask 
    of an image and Y is the predicted mask. In other words, it's twice the area of overlap 
    between the predicted and ground truth, divided by the total number of pixels in both 
    images. 

    Parameters:
    -----------
    y_true : array
        The ground truth masks.
    
    y_pred : array
        The predicted masks.

    smooth : float, optional (default is 1)
        A smoothing factor to prevent division by zero in case there's no overlap between 
        the predicted and ground truth masks.

    Returns:
    --------
    float
        The Dice coefficient, a float between 0 (complete dissimilarity) and 1 (complete similarity).
